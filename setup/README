Overview:
Chicken Soup Dashboard is a CRM system that allows for events to be created for recipients, then quick lookup for available volunteers to contact regarding that event.  The system tracks events and volunteer contacts.

Setup:
1) In this folder, use the dbsetup.sql file to create the mysql schema. 

2) Then copy the contents of mysql_header.php into a folder called "config" which is outside the html folder.

3) Modify mysql_header.php with your own database credentials.
